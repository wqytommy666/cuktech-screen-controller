# CUKTECH Screen Controller beginner guide

This guide is for people who do not normally use Terminal or write code.

> Native desktop apps are available for macOS and Windows. Windows screenshots
> and platform-specific troubleshooting are in the [Windows guide](WINDOWS_GUIDE.md).

## Before you begin

Prepare an Apple Silicon Mac running macOS 14+ or a Windows 10/11 x64 PC. Keep
the AP01 powered, pair it in Mi Home, and put the computer and AP01 on the same reachable, non-guest
LAN. Allow local incoming connections to TCP port `8765`. For the quota
dashboard, install and sign in to Claude Desktop and the official
Codex/ChatGPT app. See the full [preparation checklist](PREPARATION_CHECKLIST.md).

The project transfers screen content over Wi-Fi/LAN, not USB or the base
contacts. Local artwork does not need internet after the loader is installed.
Quota refreshes need internet on the computer. A first loader installation on a
stock screen needs both the computer and AP01 online, with the AP01 visible in Mi
Home and kept on stable power.

If the AP01 has already shown a custom image or quota dashboard, its real-time
loader is installed and normal updates only use RAM. A completely stock AP01
needs the supported loader installed once. Open **First deployment / OTA** and
choose **Gateway-free: get deployment package**. No Xiaomi gateway or manual
firmware file is required. The app checks `njcuk.enstor.ap01 / 1.0.2_0031`,
performs download-only verification, and asks again immediately before install.

## Install the app

1. Download the ZIP for your operating system from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller/releases/latest).
2. On macOS, unzip it and open `Install CUKTECH Screen Controller.command`.
3. On Windows, use **Extract All**, then open `Install CUKTECH Screen Controller.cmd`.
4. Allow local/private-network access when the operating system asks.
5. Follow the in-app **新手引导 / Getting started** readiness checks.

For a stock AP01, open **First deployment / OTA**, choose the gateway-free
package action, run download-only verification, then use the separately
confirmed install action. Users whose AP01 already shows custom content must
skip this step and must not reinstall the loader.

Choose **显示 Claude / Codex 额度** for quotas, or choose a fit mode and click
**选择图片并推送** for an image or animated GIF. The Windows Release is
self-contained and does not require a separate Python installation.

## Give the repository to a coding agent

Give Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, WorkBuddy, or another terminal-capable agent
this URL:

```text
https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller
```

Use this prompt:

```text
Read AGENTS.md, README.md, and skills/cuktech-ap01-screen-kit/SKILL.md first.
I am not a programmer, so ask for only one manual action at a time. Detect
whether this computer runs macOS or Windows and run the matching read-only
diagnostic before making changes. On Windows, read docs/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md and
do not run scripts under macos/. Configure the app/Bridge, verify
/health, validate the 320x240 GIF89a, and show a logged AP01 GET /screen.gif
200. If the real-time loader is already installed, do not use OTA. If it is
missing, verify the exact supported AP01 model and firmware and ask me again
immediately before the one-time installation. Daily updates must use /tmp RAM.
```

## If something stops updating

Open the in-app beginner guide and rerun its checks. On either platform, ask
the agent to detect the OS and repair the Bridge without OTA. Windows uses
`scripts/diagnose-windows.ps1`; macOS uses:

```text
Run ./macos/diagnose.sh and repair the Bridge without performing OTA.
```

The Bridge computer must remain logged in and connected to the same reachable
LAN. The AP01 keeps the last successful screen while that computer is offline.
