## Choose how you want to use it

CUKTECH Screen Controller provides two ways to control the AP01 display.

> New to developer tools? Start with the
> [step-by-step beginner guide](docs/BEGINNER_GUIDE.md).

> **No Xiaomi gateway is required.** A stock AP01 only needs stable power,
> an online Mi Home pairing, and a computer on the same LAN. The app's
> gateway-free onboarding action obtains a restricted FDS ticket and still
> asks for explicit confirmation immediately before the one-time Flash write.

| | Method 1: macOS / Windows app | Method 2: coding agent on macOS / Windows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Best for | Everyday use with a native UI | First-time setup, diagnostics and deep customization |
| Interface | CUKTECH Screen Controller desktop app | Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, WorkBuddy or another terminal-capable agent |
| Custom images | Choose PNG, JPG or GIF and push | Convert, validate and deploy through repository tools |
| Quota dashboard | Live Claude and Codex usage on both systems | Configurable renderer with the same account collectors |
| First-time loader | Gateway-free package, BFNP preflight and confirmed install | Complete compatibility, build and installation workflow |
| Daily refresh | Wi-Fi update to AP01 RAM | Wi-Fi update to AP01 RAM |

## Platform support

The complete daily-use workflow is available on both platforms:

- **macOS:** native SwiftUI app for Apple Silicon, macOS 14 or later;
- **Windows:** native-feeling PySide6 app for 64-bit Windows 10 and 11;
- both apps provide live preview, custom images/GIFs, Claude/Codex quota mode,
  Bridge status, login startup, onboarding, and gateway-free OTA setup;
- the **Python and coding-agent toolkit** also runs on both systems for image
  conversion, validation, diagnostics and deeper customization;
- Windows uses `scripts/setup-windows.ps1` and
  `scripts/diagnose-windows.ps1`; macOS uses the scripts under `macos/`.

See the [Windows guide](docs/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md).

## Method 1 — Install the desktop app

Download the latest **CUKTECH Screen Controller** package from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller/releases/latest).

- **Windows 10/11 x64:** extract
  `CUKTECH-Screen-Controller-0.4.0-Windows-x64.zip`, then double-click
  **`Install CUKTECH Screen Controller.cmd`**. See the
  [Windows guide](docs/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md).
- **Apple Silicon macOS:** extract
  `CUKTECH-Screen-Controller-v0.4.0-macOS-arm64.zip`, then double-click
  **`Install CUKTECH Screen Controller.command`**.

Both installers enable the login background Bridge. The Windows package is
self-contained; the macOS installer creates its isolated Python runtime on the
first run.

### Current requirements

- macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon **or** Windows 10/11 x64;
- host computer and AP01 on the same non-isolated LAN;
- Claude Desktop and the official Codex app already signed in for quota mode;
- internet access for live quotas and first-time OTA operations.
- users do **not** need to buy a Xiaomi gateway; the shared FDS relay is used
  only during the one-time loader setup.

### Network and device preparation

| Scenario | AP01 / charging station | Host computer | Internet required? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Already-patched screen showing local artwork | Powered and connected to the home LAN | Same reachable LAN with Bridge running | No; local LAN is enough |
| Claude / Codex quota dashboard | Powered and connected to the home LAN | Same LAN with the official apps signed in | **Host computer: yes**, to refresh quota data |
| First loader installation on a stock screen | Paired and online in Mi Home, with stable power | Internet access and the same reachable LAN | **AP01 and host computer: yes** |

- Normal screen delivery uses **Wi-Fi/LAN**, not USB or the base contacts;
- do not use a guest network, and disable AP/client isolation. Ethernet on the
  host is fine when it can reach the AP01 on the same LAN;
- allow incoming connections when macOS or Windows asks. VPNs and firewalls must allow local
  LAN access to TCP port `8765`;
- before a first loader installation, have the AP01 owner's Mi Home account
  available and verify model `njcuk.enstor.ap01` and firmware `1.0.2_0031`;
- keep the host awake and logged in for live refreshes. AP01 retains the last
  successful frame while the computer is asleep or offline;
- reserve the host's DHCP address in the router to avoid later IP changes.

See the full [preparation and connectivity checklist](docs/PREPARATION_CHECKLIST.md).

The app can show Bridge status, switch between quota and custom artwork,
preserve animated GIFs, select `contain` / `cover` / `stretch`, and automate
the gateway-free package, BFNP preflight, download-only verification and
explicitly confirmed installation.

> The app never silently installs firmware. It performs read-only Mi Home
> checks, obtains and verifies the package, then presents a separate explicit
> confirmation immediately before the one-time loader install.

## Method 2 — Give this repository to a coding agent

Copy this repository URL into Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, WorkBuddy, or
another coding agent that can read GitHub and run terminal commands:

```text
https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller
```

Suggested prompt:

```text
Use https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller as the source of
truth. Read AGENTS.md, README.md and
skills/cuktech-ap01-screen-kit/SKILL.md first.

I am not a programmer, so ask for one manual action at a time. I have a
CUKTECH AP01 detachable display. Detect whether this computer runs macOS or
Windows. On macOS run ./macos/diagnose.sh. On Windows read
docs/WINDOWS_GUIDE.md and run scripts/diagnose-windows.ps1. Start with read-only
compatibility and network checks. Confirm the LAN address, Bridge health, and
whether the real-time loader is already installed.

Then install the Bridge and configure either the automatic Claude/Codex quota
dashboard or my custom image. Verify /health and an AP01 GET /screen.gif 200 request, and
enable automatic startup for the current operating system. If the loader is missing, build
and validate the exact compatible image first and ask before installing it.
Normal screen refreshes must use the RAM-backed /tmp slots and must not
reinstall firmware.
```

Agents without native Codex Skill support can still read `SKILL.md` as a
complete operating guide.

The repository also includes `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, a read-only diagnostic,
and setup/diagnostic commands for both platforms:

```bash
./macos/diagnose.sh
./scripts/setup-macos.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\scripts\diagnose-windows.ps1
.\scripts\setup-windows.ps1 -InputImage "C:\Pictures\screen.png"
```

## One-time installation and daily refreshes are different

- **One-time loader installation:** writes firmware Flash once and supports
  only model `njcuk.enstor.ap01` on firmware `1.0.2_0031`.
- **Normal image and quota refreshes:** rotate GIF files through
  `/tmp/.ap01q*.gif`, which is RAM-backed. They do not rewrite firmware or
  resource partitions.
- If the Bridge computer goes offline, AP01 keeps its last successfully loaded screen and
  resumes refreshing when the bridge returns.

## What is this?

CUKTECH Screen Controller provides native macOS and Windows apps plus a cross-platform toolkit for the detachable display used
by the CUKTECH 10 charging station (`njcuk.enstor.ap01`). It provides a clean
workflow for:

- turning any image into a lightweight AP01-safe animated GIF;
- designing a high-legibility 320×240 status screen;
- rendering live quota dashboards from signed-in Claude Desktop and Codex;
- serving updates from a macOS or Windows computer over local Wi-Fi;
- installing the one-time AP01 `1.0.2_0031` real-time loader;
- changing content later without another firmware install.

The included quota dashboard is only a starting point. Replace it with artwork,
calendar, weather, energy telemetry, build status, Home Assistant metrics, or
any screen you want.

## Highlights

| Custom screen | Live quota dashboard | Lightweight runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Convert artwork to a verified 320×240 GIF89a asset. | Claude 5-hour / week / Fable 5 and Codex 5-hour / week. | Bounded animation, typically under 90 KB. |
| `contain`, `cover`, and `stretch` layouts. | Dark OLED-oriented UI, provider icons, reset clocks, Chinese labels. | AP01 stores updates in RAM-backed `/tmp`, not its resource partition. |

## Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A["Custom art or data sources"] --> B["macOS / Windows renderer and Bridge"]
  B -->|"GIF89a · 320×240 · LAN HTTP"| C["AP01 real-time loader"]
  C --> D["/tmp/.ap01q0.gif\n/tmp/.ap01q1.gif\n/tmp/.ap01q2.gif"]
  D --> E["LVGL virtual-pet screen"]
```

The first firmware installation adds the loader. Every later screen refresh is
fetched over Wi-Fi and rotated through RAM-backed files.

## Advanced and manual setup

### 1. Create a local environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wqytommy666/cuktech-screen-controller.git
cd cuktech-screen-controller
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Make a custom screen from any image

```bash
.venv/bin/python ap01_prepare_screen.py ./my-artwork.png artifacts/screen.gif \
  --fit contain --background '#01040B'
.venv/bin/python ap01_screen_bridge.py artifacts/screen.gif --port 8765
```

The converter outputs a 320×240 GIF89a. Still images become a reliable two-frame
container; animated GIFs retain visible motion with bounded frame count and
timing. Replace `artifacts/screen.gif` atomically whenever you want new content;
the AP01 will retrieve it on its next refresh.

### 3. Render a Claude + Codex dashboard

Sign in to Claude Desktop and Codex on the computer running the bridge, then run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python quota_dashboard.py
.venv/bin/python -u ap01_wifi_bridge.py --bind 0.0.0.0 --port 8765 --interval 300
```

Open `artifacts/quota-dashboard@2x.png` to inspect the design preview. The
bridge exposes:

```text
http://COMPUTER_LAN_IP:8765/screen.gif
http://COMPUTER_LAN_IP:8765/api/v1/quota
http://COMPUTER_LAN_IP:8765/health
```

Automatic account discovery supports both platforms: macOS reads the Claude
Safe Storage key through Keychain, while Windows decrypts the current user's
Claude Electron profile with DPAPI. Codex uses its local `app-server` on both.

## First-time real-time firmware setup

The built-in binary patch targets **only** AP01 model `njcuk.enstor.ap01` on
firmware **`1.0.2_0031`**. Keep the Bridge computer and AP01 on the same
non-isolated LAN and reserve that computer's DHCP address before building the URL.

```bash
# Confirm and download the matching stock image through the signed-in Mi Home account.
.venv/bin/python mi_cloud.py firmware
.venv/bin/python mi_cloud.py download

# Build a fallback screen image and inject the local HTTP loader.
.venv/bin/python ap01_custom_ota.py artifacts/screen.gif \
  --firmware artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031.bin \
  --output artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031-screen-compat.bin

.venv/bin/python ap01_realtime_patch.py \
  --input artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031-screen-compat.bin \
  --output artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031-screen-realtime.bin \
  --build-dir artifacts/realtime-build \
  --url http://COMPUTER_LAN_IP:8765/screen.gif \
  --refresh-seconds 300

# Validate transport, then install the exact prebuilt image.
.venv/bin/python ap01_install_firmware.py \
  artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031-screen-realtime.bin --download-only
.venv/bin/python ap01_install_firmware.py \
  artifacts/ap01-1.0.2_0031-screen-realtime.bin --install
```

Start the bridge before the final installation. A bridge log such as
`AP01_IP "GET /screen.gif" 200` confirms end-to-end operation.

### Xiaomi FDS upload prerequisite

#### Normal users: no gateway required

CUKTECH Screen Controller 0.4 includes a restricted shared FDS relay flow. The
desktop app sends only its private-LAN Bridge URL, refresh interval, target
model and firmware version. Mi Home credentials, AP01 DID, passwords, tokens,
and Claude/Codex sessions never leave the owner's computer. The relay rejects
arbitrary firmware uploads and builds only the reviewed loader from a
SHA-256-pinned `1.0.2_0031` stock image.

The app checks model/version and online state, downloads and verifies the
BFNP image, performs a download-only device validation, and finally asks for
explicit install confirmation. The user's own Mi Home session still sends the
OTA command to their own AP01. After that one-time step, all screens use LAN
and RAM; neither the shared relay nor a gateway is needed for daily use.

See the [relay operator guide](docs/FDS_RELAY_OPERATOR.md) for the protocol,
deployment and security boundaries.

#### Advanced users: own gateway or manual ticket

The AP01 itself has no server-side FDS upload configuration. Passing the AP01
DID/model to `/home/genpresignedurl` therefore returns `code=-6` (`invalid
config for fds`). In the original transport, these are two different device
identities:

- an FDS-enabled `lumi.gateway.*` or `xiaomi.gateway.*` identity obtains the
  signed upload URL;
- the AP01 DID receives the later `miIO.ota` download command.

There is no AP01 bucket, model alias, or hard-coded object name to enter. If
the AP01 owner's account has no FDS-enabled gateway, a trusted gateway account
can upload the **exact same BIN** and pass the short-lived signed URL back.

On the uploader's Mac/account:

```bash
.venv/bin/python ap01_install_firmware.py \
  artifacts/screen-realtime.bin \
  --upload-only --url-output /tmp/ap01-ota-url.txt
```

If automatic discovery is ambiguous, add a real gateway identity owned by
that account: `--fds-did DID --fds-model lumi.gateway.MODEL`.

On the AP01 owner's Mac/account, immediately validate download without
installing:

```bash
.venv/bin/python ap01_install_firmware.py \
  artifacts/screen-realtime.bin \
  --download-only --ota-url-file /path/to/ap01-ota-url.txt --timeout 360
```

The signed URL is transferable, but temporary. Both sides must use the same
BIN bytes; do not rebuild between upload and download validation.

For an agent-ready Chinese runbook with diagnostics and completion criteria,
see [AP01 FDS solution without a local gateway](docs/AP01_FDS_NO_GATEWAY_SOLUTION.zh-CN.md).

## Screen contract

| Requirement | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Physical display | 320×240 |
| Container | GIF89a |
| Animation | At least 2 frames; slow animation is preferred |
| Recommended size | ≤ 90 KB |
| Firmware slot limit | 221,445 bytes |
| Runtime loader limit | 256 KiB |
| Overlay reserve | Leave rows 0–39 clear to preserve the stock clock/date |

## Flash behavior

Firmware installation is a one-time Flash write. Normal content and quota
refreshes are different: the loader writes GIF slots, metadata, and its ACK
record only to these RAM-backed paths:

```text
/tmp/.ap01q0.gif
/tmp/.ap01q1.gif
/tmp/.ap01q2.gif
/tmp/.ap01q.meta
/tmp/.ap01q.ack
```

That means changing artwork or refreshing quotas does **not** repeatedly write
the AP01 firmware or resource partitions.

## Privacy

- Claude and Codex data is fetched from official clients signed in as the local
  macOS or Windows user.
- Session credentials remain in memory.
- Rendered JSON contains quota values only.
- The repository excludes firmware images, Xiaomi account credentials, signed
  download URLs, device IDs, local IP addresses, and generated artifacts.

## Coding-agent Skill

This repository includes a self-contained Codex skill:

```bash
cp -R skills/cuktech-ap01-screen-kit ~/.codex/skills/
```

Then use prompts such as:

```text
Use $cuktech-ap01-screen-kit to turn this image into an AP01 screen.
Use $cuktech-ap01-screen-kit to design and deploy a Claude/Codex quota dashboard.
Use $cuktech-ap01-screen-kit to diagnose why AP01 is not refreshing.
```

The skill contains the reusable project template, deterministic converters,
firmware workflow, network checks, and bilingual task guidance.
